# Worklog

Development session notes capturing what changed, why, and lessons learned. Each entry documents a focused unit of work (a feature, redesign, or fix) after completion.

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

## Entry Structure

Each worklog entry should include:

- **Date, branch, commit/PR** — traceability back to the code
- **Summary** — one-sentence description of the work
- **What Changed** — markup, styles, logic, and documentation changes
- **Design Decisions** — rationale for non-obvious choices
- **Bug Fixes / Lessons Learned** — issues encountered and how they were resolved
